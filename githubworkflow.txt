Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository. A repository can have multiple workflows that perform a different set of tasks.
For example, one workflow to build and test pull requests, another workflow to deploy your application every time a release is created,
and still another workflow that adds a label every time someone opens a new issue.
